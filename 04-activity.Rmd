- Now it's your turn!
- You can find a data set titled "cons_perf.csv" in the supplemental material linked [here](https://github.com/jimmyrigby94/Data-Management-in-R/tree/master/suppl).
- A .txt file (cons_perf_desc.txt) is also included describing the data and structure.
- Your goal is to clean the data and then summarise the data in a meaningful way.
