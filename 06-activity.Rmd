- Let's see what you've learned!
- [Relational databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) are a common way to store data.
- Information associated with different levels is stored in separate tables.
- Tables are linked with foreign keys, a fancy name for ID variables.
- This organization reduces memory demands, but requires a strong knowledge of joins to extract piece together the information.
- [IMBD](https://www.imdb.com/) stores their data about movies in a relational database format. 
- You can find a description of the data files title IMDB.txt in the suppl folder, linked [here](https://github.com/jimmyrigby94/Data-Management-in-R/tree/master/suppl).
- Again, instructions may be ambiguous.
- This is done intentionally to facilitate critical thinking when applying the principles learned above. 
- Feel free to use other functions unless explictly told not to do so.

**Data Cleaning**

1. Load the following .csv's into your environment

    - ratings.csv
    - titles.csv
    - principal_actors.csv
    - names.csv
    
2. Merge the principal_actors and names data frames retaining all observations to create a data frame title cinematic_pros.

3. Create a new object call actors that only contains information about actor-movie combinations where they are explicitly categorized as actors. 

4. Are there actors that for whom we don't have movie history? 

5. How many actors are missing movie information?

6. Merge the titles and ratings data sets retaining all observations in title to create a new dataframe called movies.

7. Merge actors and movies using your favorite mutating join. 

8. Calculate summary statistics using the actors unique id. Store the below information in an object titled actor_summaries


    - Count the number of movies each actor has been in.
    - Calculate the average ratings for each actor.
    - Create a cumulative distribution variable for the actors' average ratings.
    
    
9. Plot the rating cumulative distribution.

10. Using the actor_summaries and movies, create a data frame that contains the movie information for the actors with ratings in the top 10%.
