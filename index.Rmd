# (PART) Data Management with Dplyr {-}

# Prerequisites

- This book assumes that you are familiar with the basics of the R language.

- While we will review logic some logical operators, we will not discuss basic arithmatic operators, common functions (i.e., mean), or data structures. 

- Please review the material on base R if you are still uncomfortable with the foundations of the language.

- If you have yet to do so please install and load tidyverse by running the following code

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install tidyverse
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Load tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
```
