# Introduction

## Prerequisites

- This book assumes that you are familiar with the basics of the R language.

- Thus, we will not discuss basic arithmatic operators, common functions (i.e., mean), or data structures. 

- Please review the material on base R if you are still uncomfortable with the foundations of the language.

- Datacamp offers a great set of courses (linked [here](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)) that will help get you up to speed.

- If you have yet to do so please install and load tidyverse by running the following code```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install tidyverse
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Load tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
```

## Supplemental Resources

This is by no means the only resource to learn data management skills in R. My aim is to provide a somewhat biased overview of how data management should be done in R. I draw heavily on packages from the tidyverse because they result in type consistent output and incorporate piping making them easier to use and interpret when compared to their base R counterparts. Here are additional that may provide different perspectives or additional insight into data management in R.
